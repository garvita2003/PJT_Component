# PJT_Component

Apply multiple Machine Learning Algorithm i.e Logistic Regression, MLP, GaussianNB, etc to each of the multiple dataset of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and check their evaluation metrics with and without preprocessing of the dataset to showcase the importance of the preprocessing of the dataset. The world has experienced a radical change due to the internet. Internet became a crucial element in our daily life, therefore, the security of our Data could be threatened at any time. This safety is handled using systems to detect network intrusion called Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Machine learning techniques are being implemented to improve these systems. In order to enhance the performance of IDS, different classification algorithms are applied to detect various types of attacks.  The best method is to test the performance of the different classification algorithms. Nevertheless, most researchers have focused on the confusion matrix as measurements of classification performance. Therefore, many papers use this matrix to present a detailed comparison with the dataset, data preprocessing, feature selection technique, algorithms classification and performance evaluation. The goal of this project is to present a comparison of application of different Machine Learning algorithms used to build and improve intrusion detection systems in terms of confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, precision, FAR, specificity and sensitivity using the various of Dataset. This Project consist of multiple datasets undergoes multiple machine learning algorithms and discuss on the nature of IDS datasets, designate and choose one good performing algorithm based on the results achieved by evaluation metrics and other measuring factors. This project also discuss why that algorithm is performing good in context with IDS, mathematical construction of that algorithm, importance of feature selection and preprocessing etc.
